# HR-Analysis-Dashboard-Project
Data Analytics Project

Hi, Welcome to my data analyst project, where I used a variety of tools to derive insights from employee data and create a comprehensive dashboard for employee retention analysis.
This project in the field of human resources examines how employees at various levels within an organization are leaving their jobs. The analysis of attrition rates takes into account several factors, including the employees' monthly earnings, the year of their last promotion, their job roles, and their work-life balance. This analysis is conducted for employees in various departments.

Data Points Analyzed:

1. Average Attrition rate for all Departments
2. Average Hourly rate of Male Research Scientist
3. Attrition rate Vs Monthly income stats
4. Average working years for each Department
5. Job Role Vs Work life balance
6. Attrition rate Vs Year since last promotion relation

Tools used:-
Microsoft Excel, Power BI
